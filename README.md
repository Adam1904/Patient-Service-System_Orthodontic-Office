# Patient Service System- Orthodontic Office

Project for JAVA Programming in the winter semester 2021/2022, simulating a patient service system in an orthodontic office

## Setup

Before the first run you need to make sure that all .jar files are included in the project. You'll find them in the resources folder (in your `./resources`)

## About

The project is based on an interactive event-driven response and provides the user with a large number of possible office management and patient service functions.
The system uses a database located in a cloud provided by GoogleCloud Platform, which uses the smallest possible computing power for testing purposes.
The program is designed to provide interactive responses to the situations that the user wants to perform and tries to handle personal data in the most secure way possible.
